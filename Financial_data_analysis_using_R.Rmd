Q2. Data exploration 
(a) some questions to consider:
(i) What is the proportion of defaults (‘charged off’ vs ‘fully paid’ loans) in the data? How does default rate vary with loan grade? Does it vary with sub-grade? And is this what you would expect, and why?

```{r}
# Grouping data by loan status 
lcdf %>% group_by(loan_status) %>% tally()

# How default rate varies by grade
lcdf %>% group_by(grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n(), defaults=sum(loan_status=="Charged Off"), defaultRate=defaults/nLoans) 

# Default rate varies by sub_grade
lcdf %>% group_by(sub_grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n(), defaults=sum(loan_status=="Charged Off"), defaultRate=defaults/nLoans) 

# How many loans are there in each grade?
lcdf %>% group_by(grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n())

# Does loan amount vary by grade?
lcdf %>% group_by(loan_amnt,grade) %>% tally() 

# How interest rate varies by grade, sub grade 
lcdf %>% group_by(int_rate, grade, sub_grade) %>% tally()

# Visualizing interest rate and grade
ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = lcdf$int_rate)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill=grade))

# What is the proportion of defaults (‘charged off’ vs ‘fully paid’ loans) in the data?
lcdf %>% group_by(loan_status) %>% tally()

# How does default rate vary with loan grade? As the loan grade increase the default rate increase which implies a strong positive relation between the attributes.
lcdf %>% group_by(grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n(), defaults=sum(loan_status=="Charged Off"), defaultRate=defaults/nLoans)

# Does it vary with sub-grade? Since the major loan grades are the basis for the distinction between the sub grades, a similar pattern can be observed in the sub grade comparison as well.
lcdf %>% group_by(sub_grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n(), defaults=sum(loan_status=="Charged Off"), defaultRate=defaults/nLoans)
```

ii) How many loans are there in each grade? And do loan amounts vary by grade? Does interest rate for loans vary with grade, subgrade? Look at the average, standard-deviation, min and max of interest rate by grade and subgrade. Is this what you expect, and why?

```{r}
# Grouping data by grade to get the number of loans
lcdf %>% group_by(grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n()) 

# And does loan amount vary by grade - There is no clear pattern or a relevant relation between the two variables.
lcdf %>% group_by(grade) %>% summarise(mean(loan_amnt))

# Does interest rate for loans vary with grade and subgrade? Yes the interest rate for loans vary with grade and sub grade with a strong positive relation. This is also a core concept in Lending Club's business model. refer to the visualizations for both.
lcdf %>% group_by(grade,sub_grade) %>% summarise(mean(int_rate))

# Visualization against grade
ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = lcdf$int_rate)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill=grade))

# Visualization against sub-grade
ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = lcdf$int_rate)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill = sub_grade))

# Computing the average, standard-deviation min and max of interest rate by grade and sub grade. - The mean, standard deviation and maximum for interest rate have a positive direct relation with grade and sub-grade. However, there is no clear or relevant relation between minimum interest rate and grade, sub grade.
lcdf %>% group_by(grade,sub_grade) %>% summarise(mean(int_rate))

lcdf %>% group_by(grade,sub_grade) %>% summarise(sd(int_rate)) 

lcdf %>% group_by(grade,sub_grade) %>% summarise(min(int_rate)) 

lcdf %>% group_by(grade,sub_grade) %>% summarise(max(int_rate))
```

iii) For loans which are fully paid back, how does the time-to-full-payoff vary? For this, calculate the ‘actual term’ (issue-date to last-payment-date) for all loans. How does this actual-term vary by loan grade (a box-plot can help visualize this).

```{r}
# For loans which are fully paid back, how does the time-to-full-payoff vary? 
# Term of the loan is the duration between the last-payment-date and the loan issue-date
# First check the format of these two columns with date values
head(lcdf[, c("last_pymnt_d", "issue_d")])

# First step is to past "01-" to the character string, to get something like "01-Dec-2018", i.e. first of each month 
lcdf$last_pymnt_d<-paste(lcdf$last_pymnt_d, "-01", sep = "")

# Then convert this character to a date type variable
lcdf$last_pymnt_d<-parse_date_time(lcdf$last_pymnt_d,  "myd")

# Check their format now
head(lcdf[, c("last_pymnt_d", "issue_d")])


# Now we can compute the duration between two dates using 
#      as.duration(lcdf$issue_d  %--% lcdf$last_pymnt_d))
#   This will return the duration in seconds -- try  
#          x<- as.duration(lcdf$issue_d  %--% lcdf$last_pymnt_d)
#          head(x)
#     To convert it to duration in weeks, we can use 
#          x<- as.duration(lcdf$issue_d  %--% lcdf$last_pymnt_d)/dweeks(1)
#      Or to get the duration in years
#          x<- as.duration(lcdf$issue_d  %--% lcdf$last_pymnt_d)/dyears(1)
#
# Another issue to consider: what about those loans which are charged-off? These are not paid back fully by the end of the 3-year term, so the duration as calculated above will not give the accurate value for the actual-term. For these loans, we can set the actual-term at 3.


# Actual term can be calculated as
lcdf$actualTerm <- ifelse(lcdf$loan_status=="Fully Paid", as.duration(lcdf$issue_d  %--% lcdf$last_pymnt_d)/dyears(1), 3)
head(lcdf$actualTerm)

# Visualizing actual term to grade - It can be rightly drawn from observing the box plot that as the loan grade increases to higher risk the actual term is pushed more towards finalized term period (3 years). Majority of those (higher risk loans) also contribute to no return towards the end of the term.
qplot(grade, actualTerm, data = lcdf, geom=c("boxplot"))

# Actual return can be calculated as
lcdf$actualReturn <- ifelse(lcdf$actualTerm>0, ((lcdf$total_pymnt-lcdf$funded_amnt)/lcdf$funded_amnt)*(1/lcdf$actualTerm)*100, 0) *(12/36)/100

```



iv) Calculate the annual return. Show how you calculate the percentage annual return. Is there any return from loans which are ‘charged off’? Explain. How does return from charged -off loans vary by loan grade? Compare the average return values with the average interest_rate on loans – do you notice any differences, and how do you explain this? How do returns vary by grade, and by sub-grade. If you wanted to invest in loans based on this data exploration, which loans would you invest in?

```{r}
# Payments from charged off loans
lcdf %>% filter(loan_status=='Charged Off') %>% summarise(funded_amnt,total_pymnt)

# avgPmnt is the returns from the charged off loans based upon grade
lcdf %>% group_by(grade) %>% summarise(nLoans=n(), defaults=sum(loan_status=="Charged Off"), defaultRate=defaults/nLoans, avgInterest= mean(int_rate), stdInterest=sd(int_rate), avgLoanAMt=mean(loan_amnt), avgPmnt=mean(total_pymnt))
lcdf %>% select(loan_status, int_rate, funded_amnt, total_pymnt) %>% head()

# Annual return in $
lcdf$annualRet <- ((lcdf$total_pymnt-lcdf$funded_amnt))*(12/36)
lcdf$annualRet

# % annual return
lcdf$annRet <- ((lcdf$total_pymnt -lcdf$funded_amnt)/lcdf$funded_amnt)*(12/36)*100
lcdf$annRet

# No of loans charged off - 12146
lcdf %>% select(loan_status, int_rate, funded_amnt, total_pymnt, annRet) %>% filter(annRet < 0) %>% count(loan_status)

# division between grade and sub grade - The annual return decreases with increase in risk based on grades and sub-grade but the is no strong pattern observed. But the relation among the attributes annual return and grade + sub grade is inversely proportional. 
lcdf%>% group_by(grade,sub_grade)%>% summarise(mean(annualRet))

```

v) What are people borrowing money for (purpose)? Examine how many loans, average amounts, etc. by purpose? Do loan amounts vary by purpose? Do defaults vary by purpose? Does loan-grade assigned by Lending Club vary by purpose?

```{r}
# purpose of the loan 
lcdf %>% group_by(purpose) %>% tally()
# There is no relation between purpose and the loan amount
lcdf %>% group_by(purpose) %>% summarise(avg_funded_amt=mean(funded_amnt))
# There is no relation between purpose and the loan status
lcdf %>% group_by(purpose) %>% summarise(no_of_defualts=sum(loan_status=='Charged Off'))
# The loan grade assigned by Lending Club does not vary by purpose.
lcdf %>% group_by(purpose,grade) %>% tally()
```

vi) Consider some borrower characteristics like employment-length, annual-income, fico-scores (low, high). How do these relate to loan attribute like, for example, loan_amout, loan_status, grade, purpose, actual return, etc.

```{r}
############# How does employment length relate to various loan attributes. #############
lcDgEmpLen <- lcdf %>% group_by(emp_length) %>% tally()

#convert emp_length to factor -- with factor levels ordered in a meaningful way
lcdf$emp_length <- factor(lcdf$emp_length, levels=c("n/a", "< 1 year","1 year","2 years", "3 years" ,  "4 years",   "5 years",   "6 years",   "7 years" ,  "8 years", "9 years", "10+ years" ))

# vary by loan amount - With increase in employment length the spread for loans approved across various loan amount increases which can be observed for groups '10+ years' and '9 years'. For people with employment length between 3 to 8 years this spread decreases. However, for employment length between 1 to years the loan amount is concentrated around loan amount less than 20000. Also, if we test the association between the attributes it shows a weak positive relation.

# vary by loan status - A common trend observed is lower rate of "charged off" loans vs "fully paid" for various employment length. Also, if we test the association between the attributes it shows a positive relation, however, it's very weak.
table(lcdf$loan_status, lcdf$emp_length)
ggplot(lcdf, aes( x = emp_length)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=loan_status))
# correlation
cor.test(as.numeric(as.factor(lcdf$loan_status)), as.numeric(lcdf$emp_length))

# correlation
cor.test(as.numeric(as.factor(lcdf$grade)), as.numeric(lcdf$emp_length))

# correlation

############# How does annual income relate to various loan attributes. #############

# vary by loan amount - The relation between average loan amount and average loan income is a strong positive relation when grouped with grades. The association is very high for both the attributes. 
# correlation between grade and annual income
cor.test(as.numeric(as.factor(lcdf$grade)), lcdf$annual_inc)

# since a relatively strong negative association we can group them as

ggplot(dfGrpInc, aes( x = avgIncome)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill=grade))
# correlation

# vary by purpose - Borrower with lower annual income majorly use the loan for wedding and vacation while the borrowers with higher average income use it for home improvement and small business. We need more variables to derive a strong relation among the attributes but from the correlation test it is clear that the variables have a weak negative association.

vii) Generate some (at least 3) new derived attributes which you think may be useful for predicting default., and explain what these are. For these, do an analyses as in the questions above (as reasonable based on the derived variables).

```{r}
#### Derived variables
# Actual Annual Return (validate above for actual term)
# Amounts owed by the borrower: lcdf$score_dti (line no. - 274)
# Credit history of the borrower: lcdf$score_credhist (line no. - 279)
# Credit mix of the borrower: lcdf$score_cred (line no. - 282)
# New credit of the borrower: lcdf$score_newcred (line no. - 285)
# Delinquency term of the borrower: lcdf$score_delinq (line no. - 288)
# Delinquency amount of the borrower: lcdf$score_delinq_amn (line no. - 291)
# Fico score: lcdf$score (line no. - 294)
# 
# (Resource: https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/whats-in-your-credit-score)

############# How does amounts owed by borrower relate to various loan attributes. #############
# calculating sum of the various credit 

# vary by loan status - As the debt to income ratio increases number of fully paid loans increases, which implies a strong positive relation among the attributes.
count <- table(lcdf$loan_status, lcdf$score_dti)

barplot(count, main="score_dti", xlabel="Amounts owed based on loan status", legend = c("Charged-off", "Fully paid"))

#vary by grade - As the debt to income ratio increases number of approved loans for higher grades decreases, which implies a strong negative relation among the attributes.
counts <- table(lcdf$grade, lcdf$score_dti)

barplot(counts, main="score_dti", xlabel="Amounts owed based on grade", legend = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"))

############# How does  by borrower relate to various loan attributes. #############

# vary by loan status - As the delinquency amount increases the number of loans fully paid becomes 0 the charged off loans are slightly above 0. And, for lower delinquency amount the count for fully paid loans increases, which shows a weak relationship among the variables.
number <- table(lcdf$loan_status, lcdf$score_delinq_amnt)

barplot(number, main="score_delinq_amnt", xlabel="Amount deliquency based on loan status", legend = c("Charged-off", "Fully paid"))

#vary by grade - There is no clear pattern observed and the relation among the variables cannot be determined.
numbers <- table(lcdf$grade, lcdf$score_delinq_amnt)

barplot(numbers, main="score_delinq_amnt", xlabel="Amounts deliquency based on grade", legend = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"))
```

(b) Summarize your conclusions and main themes from your analyses

Ans. The main themes observed are across all variables are that the employment length, grade, sub grade, actual return and average income have strong contribution towards the loan status, borrower profile and many more derived variables. SOme of the derived variables like fico score, and attributes around fico score help evaluate the borrower profile and identify potential risk at an early stage. For a detailed view refer to the values and conclusions discussed above.

(c) Are there missing values? What is the proportion of missing values in different variables?
Explain how you will handle missing values for different variables. You should consider what the variable is about, and what missing values may arise from – for example, a variable 
monthsSinceLastDeliquency may have no value for someone who has not yet had a delinquency; 
what is a sensible value to replace the missing values in this case?
Are there some variables you will exclude from your model due to missing values?

```{r}
lcd <- names(lcdf)[colSums(is.na(lcdf))>0.6]
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(lcd))
write.table(lcdf, file = 'LCDFFINAL.csv',sep = "," )
```

There are missing values in a lot of the variables in the following proportion mentioned below:

We have dropped the variables with over 60% missing values as manipulating and replacing the missing values would not give us a good model later.

To handle the missing values we would use mean, median or mode for the variable depending on what the variable represents.

Variables like monthsSinceLastDeliquency where the empty fields mean that the person has not defaulted and thus there is no value entered in the field, we simply replace it by zero to make sense out of it.

The variables that we should drop from the dataframe are mentioned in the below answer. These variables are either not necessary for the analysis or they do not make sense.



Q3. Consider the potential for data leakage. You do not want to include variables in your model which may not be available when applying the model; that is, some data may not be available for new loans before they are funded. Leakage may also arise from variables in the data which may have been updated during the loan period (ie., after the loan is funded). Identify and explain which variables will you exclude from the model.

```{r}
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(funded_amnt_inv)) 
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(loan_status)) 
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(revol_bal)) 
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(out_prncp)) 
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(out_prncp_inv)) 
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(mths_since_last_delinq))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(revol_util, total_pymnt))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(total_pymnt_inv)) 
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(total_rec_prncp ))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(total_rec_int ))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(total_rec_late_fee))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(recoveries))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(collection_recovery_fee))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(last_pymnt_amt))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(issue_d))
 lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(addr_state))
lcdf = subset(lcdf, select = -c(open_acc,policy_code, mths_since_recent_inq))
lcdf = subset(lcdf, select = -c(emp_title, addr_state, zip_code))
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(last_credit_pull_d))
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(chargeoff_within_12_mths ))
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(delinq_amnt))
lcdf = subset(lcdf,select = -c(tot_cur_bal))
```


Ans. List of attributes that can potentially cause data leakage:

Funded_amount_inv, loan_status, revol_bal, out_prncp, out_prncp_inv, mths_since_last_delinq, revol_util, total_pymnt, total_pymnt_inv, total_rec_prncp, total_rec_prncp, total_rec_int, total_rec_int, total_rec_late_fee, recoveries, collection_recovery_fee, last_pymnt_amt, last_credit_pull_d, collections_12_mnths_ex_med, tot_coll_amnt,total_cur_bal, chargeoff_within_12_mths, delinq_amt

The attributes mentioned above should be excluded since it could potentially affect the accuracy of the model since these attributes were included after the loan was sanctioned. Adding these attributes would definitely increase the accuracy of but it would not be a realistic representation of the data that we have while deciding whether to sanction the loan or not.


List of attributes that we would exclude from the dataset while training the model are as follows:

Issue_d, emp_title, addr_state, zip_code, inq_last_6mths, inq_last_12mths, open_acc, last_pymt_d, policy_code, mths_since_recent_inq

The attributes mentioned above are being excluded from the dataset because these are redundant data which would not have any value addition to the model.

Q4. Do a univariate analyses to determine which variables (from amongst those you decide to consider for the next stage prediction task) will be individually useful for predicting the dependent variable (loan_status). For this, you need a measure of relationship between the dependent variable and each of the potential predictor variables. Given loan-status as a binary dependent variable, which measure will you use? From your analyses using this measure, which variables do you think will be useful for predicting loan_status? (Note – if certain variables on their own are highly predictive of the outcome, it is good to ask if this variable has a leakage issue).

```{r}
aucsNum<-sapply(lcdf %>% select_if(is.numeric), auc, response=lcdf$loan_status))
aucAll<- sapply(lcdf %>% mutate_if(is.factor, as.numeric) %>% select_if(is.numeric), auc, response=lcdf$loan_status)
aucAll[aucAll>0.5]
```

After performing the univariate analysis, we get the values as follows:

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
